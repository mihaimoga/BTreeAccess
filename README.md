# BTreeAccess

**BTreeAccess** is a C++ project focused on demonstrating and implementing B-tree data structures, commonly used in databases and file systems for efficient data storage and retrieval. This repository includes source code, documentation, and examples that illustrate the concepts and applications of B-trees.

## Features

- Implementation of B-tree structures in C++
- GUI components for interacting with B-tree data
- Educational resources and examples for understanding B-tree operations
- Modular design with separate components for file handling, dialogs, and homework exercises

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project, youâ€™ll need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., MSVC, GCC)
- Windows development environment (Visual Studio recommended)
- Basic understanding of B-tree data structures

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mihaimoga/BTreeAccess.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution using the provided .sln file.

### Running

After building, run the executable to explore the B-tree operations and GUI interface. The application provides interactive dialogs for file access and B-tree manipulation.
